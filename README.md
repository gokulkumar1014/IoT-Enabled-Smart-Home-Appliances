# IoT-Enabled-Smart-Home-Appliances
## Overview:
* A home automation system is a means that allow users to control electric appliances of varying kind.
* Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control system, involving remote controlled switches as it becomes more difficult for the elderly or physically handicapped people to do so. 
* The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation system using an Arduino board and few sensors that gives you remote or automatic control of things in and around the home.
* The systems that you could control include : lighting, Security and monitoring system, Heating and cooling system.

## Description:
* The sensors connected to the microcontroller board are Smoke Detector, PIR, Ultrasonic and LDR sensor.
* Smoke detector is used to sense the Gas for leakage. If there is a leakage detected from the data sensed the alarm gets active.
* The Ultrasonic sensors are used for automatic opening of doors if a person stands in front of them.
* The PIR-Passive infra red sensor is used for detection of human and turn ON the fan. The fan can also be controlled manually.
* LDR is used for automatic light control in home if someone is in home at night the bulb is automatically turned ON and at day time it automatically turned OFF.


## Components:
1. ARDUINO UNO R3
2. SMOKE DETECTOR MQ6
3. PIR MOTION SENSOR
4. LDR LIGHT SENSOR MODULE
5. ULTRASONIC SENSORS
6. DC POWER SOURCE (15v) 
7. RELAY BOARD OF 2 CHANNEL

## Conclusion:
* The system consists of mainly three components: Arduino UNO, variety of sensors and relay circuits and the approach discussed is novel and had achieved the target with the minimal level of cost. The system makes the basic level of appliance control that provides simplicity, flexibility , reliability and a low cost system that is affordable to middle class families too. 
* The system design and architecture were discussed, and prototype presents the basic level of home appliance control. Finally, the proposed system is better from the scalability and flexibility point of view than the commercially available home automation systems.
* The team truly believes that home automation is the next big step in the lives of consumers. With more time and resources, it is possible to solve the problems encountered throughout this project turning the prototype into an actual product. The final conclusion would be that the prototype is functional, yet requires more work to complete all the functionalities that would be required of a commercial product.
